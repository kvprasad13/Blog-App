    title: `All You Need To Know About Bessel Functions`, text: `Those were the days when an astronomer could still make substantial contributions to mathematics! Bessel functions, first introduced by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel in the early 19th century, are mathematical functions that arise in various areas of science, engineering, and mathematics. They were and have since become fundamental tools in many fields, including physics, signal processing, and applied mathematics. For Bessel, it was probably mainly the applications in optics, that interested him most: Bessel functions play a crucial role in the study of diffraction, which is the bending or spreading of waves around obstacles or through narrow openings. The diffraction patterns produced by circular apertures or obstacles can be mathematically described using Bessel functions. And to understand diffraction patterns is of course crucial, if you want to build better telescopes, as Bessel did.
In this article, we will explore the world of Bessel functions, understand their properties, and learn how to leverage them in Python for practical applications.Bessel functions are a family of solutions to Bessel’s differential equation, which is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation, which appears naturally in the description of diffraction patterns around circular openings.

Consider a circular aperture, such as a small hole or a circular obstacle in an otherwise unobstructed medium. When a wave, such as light or sound, passes through this circular aperture, it undergoes diffraction. The diffracted wave spreads out in a pattern of concentric circular waves, known as the diffraction pattern.

To mathematically describe this diffraction pattern, we need to solve the wave equation in the vicinity of the aperture. In cylindrical coordinates, the wave equation separates into three parts: a radial part, an azimuthal part, and a temporal part. It is the…

    title: `The Portfolio that Got Me a Data Scientist Job`, text: `Getting a Data Scientist job is hard.

This isn't 2015 anymore: it's not enough to know a few pandas functions and put the words “Big Data” on your résumé. Competition for the top jobs is fierce. On a recent trawl through the LinkedIn jobs board, I struggled to find a London-based Data Scientist role with less than 100 applicants.

The good news is that this competition is not due to a lack of jobs. Even in 2023, Data Science remains a fast-growing field, and the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics has estimated that the number of Data Scientist jobs will grow by 36% between 2021 and 2031 [1].

The challenge, then, is not that there are no Data Science jobs — there are tons! Rather, it’s that a huge number of people are trying to break into the industry, making it increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd and land that lucrative first role.`},

    title: `How I Cracked the Meta Machine Learning Engineering Interview`, text: ` recently landed an offer with Meta as Machine Learning Engineer (MLE), gaining a 20% raise in my total compensation relative to my previous job as well as a promotion to a senior role. In this post I’ll outline the interview structure, how I prepared, and practical tips on how to nail the MLE interview. Even though my experience was with Meta, I believe this guide to be useful for MLE interviews with other tech companies as well. Good luck!

Interview structure
I actually did not apply myself, instead a recruiter reached out via LinkedIn. This is a good reminder to keep your LinkedIn profile polished and up-to-date. I did one phone screen and one virtual on-site:

The phone screen lasted for one hour and included two coding questions.
The virtual onsite was spread over 2 days. Day 1 included one coding interview, one behavior interview, and two design rounds: system design and ML system design. Day 2 included originally one coding round and one behavior round, but the latter was canceled in the last minute, so I ended up just doing a single coding round on Day 2.
The coding interviews
I did in total 3 coding rounds, one in the phone screen and 2 during onsite. Each coding round had 2 Leetcode Medium questions that I needed to solve in around 1 hour, resulting in a total of 6 coding problems. Typically one interview had one very common question (within the Leetcode top-10 Facebook-tagged questions) and one more obscure question (within the top-300).

I practiced by studying the most frequent Facebook-tagged questions from the past 6 months on Leetcode (this functionality is a good reason for purchasing Leetcode Premium). Instead of quantity, I focused on quality: I tried to really understanding the different approaches to solve the most common questions, and why the different approaches worked, and why my first attempts did not work. Overall I practiced 137 / 350 Leetcode questions.` },

    title: `Why Experienced Programmers Fail Coding Interviews`, text: `A friend of mine recently joined a FAANG company as an engineering manager, and found themselves in the position of recruiting for engineering candidates.

We caught up.

“Well,” I laughed when they inquired about the possibility of me joining the team, “I’m not sure I’ll pass the interviews, but of course I’d love to work with you again! I’ll think about it.”

“That's the same thing X and Y both said,” they told me, referring to other engineers we had worked with together. “They both said they weren't qualified.”

I nodded in understanding, but a part of my mind was also wincing. Those other engineers my friend referred to were solid senior engineers — great communicators, collaborators, and great at solving technical problems. We both knew this, since we had all worked together for almost two years.

But could they pass the interview bar for the company my friend had recently joined? The outcome could be a coin toss. “Well,” my friend allowed, “my advice would be to do a little practice first. Get some interviews in at other companies, too; don't go in cold.”

And such is the reality of an experienced programmer looking to find a new job.

Why do experienced programmers fail at interviews? Here are my musings.` },

    title: `5 Ways I'm Using AI to Make Money in 2023`, text: `I've been using AI tools to help grow my one-woman business for the past year.

Honestly, it's been a game-changer.

For example, with the help of AI, I was able to DOUBLE my income last year without working more hours.

My business model didn't change. I didn't hire anyone. The only thing that changed was how I used AI to work more productively and efficiently.

So I thought I'd share some of the ways that I'm currently using AI to make money in 2023.

1. YouTube

I've been creating faceless YouTube channels for a few years now.

At this point, I have a few dozen channels in various “boring” niches. But combined, they add up to a substantial monthly income from both YouTube Adsense and affiliate products.

Most of the videos I create are evergreen, meaning the content should be relevant for at least a few years.

I also create videos around products that I can promote using an affiliate link, so the videos start earning right away, even if the channel isn't monetized with Adsense.

However, coming up with video topics, titles, and scripts takes a lot of time, especially when you're a solopreneur who is always juggling a dozen projects.

Last year I started using the Jasper AI writing assistant to help speed up the process.

Jasper is able to come up with video topic ideas, SEO-optimized titles, script outlines, hooks, and an introduction.

Once I have my outline, I can use Jasper's “Compose” feature to fill in the blanks for each section of my script.

Here's a basic example of what this looks like on my end:
